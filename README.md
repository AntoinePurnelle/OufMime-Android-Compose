# OufMime-Android-Compose

Android app developped in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose as a learning project.

OufMime is a family game where two teams will try to guess the most words.
It is played in three rounds:
1. The player can describe the word to his team. He can't translate it, use another word of the same ethimology or mime it. Teammates have as many guess as they want
2. Reusing the same set of words as in the first round, the payer can only une one word to describe the one to guess. Teammates have only one guess per word
3. Still using the same set, the player has to mime the word. He can make sounds but cannot pronounce a word. Teammates have as many guess as they want

Only available in French at the moment. English translation coming.
